### Hello friend.

Below you will find a short yet raw-noodle-sharp list of attributes which prime me for internet-synergy.

- I done loads of codes mate, ask anyone
- I am happy to work with JPEGS of all shapes and sizes, I am 100% without prejudice
- I once shook hands with someone who looked a lot like Jamiroquai but later turned out to be a mannequin that had been slung into a skip behind Debenhams
- If left to my own devices I hum tunes that are exciting and terrifying in equal measure
- I made a game called PISSMAN that has sold over 40 copies
- When I make sandwiches that contain cucumber I have a special technique for extracting the cucumber from its glossy, cylindrical carapace.
- I cannot ride a horse

MANY THANKS AND GOODBYE.
