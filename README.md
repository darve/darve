### Hello friend.

> <s>üç∫ I am looking for work</s>.

I am a full-stack javascript developer with 12 years experience with building websites, applications and games. I am currently enjoying working with Preact on the front end and Express / Mongo / Redis on the back-end. I'm also the co-founder of [Symplify](https://www.symplify.co.uk) - software startup that provides a digital platform for Speech and Language therapists. Symplify is a subscription service that empowers therapists with powerful tools and communication-rich therapy activities to augment their therapy sessions.

Generative art is a huge passion of mine - I use programming to create patterns and shapes that can be drawn by Stephen (my pen robot). You can read more about that over at [hyperkinetic.art](https://www.hyperkinetic.art).

If you are in pursuit of piping-hot dev juice, look no further. Below you will find a short yet raw-noodle-sharp list of attributes which prime me for internet-synergy.

- I done loads of codes mate, ask anyone
- I am happy to work with JPEGS of all shapes and sizes, I am 100% without prejudice
- I once shook hands with someone who looked a lot like Jamiroquai but later turned out to be a mannequin that had been slung into a skip behind Debenhams
- If left to my own devices I hum tunes that are exciting and terrifying in equal measure
- I made a game called PISSMAN that has sold over 40 copies
- When I make sandwiches that contain cucumber I have a special technique for extracting the cucumber from its glossy, cylindrical carapace.
- I cannot ride a horse

MANY THANKS AND GOODBYE.
