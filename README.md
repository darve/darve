### Hello friend.

> üç∫ I am looking for work.

I am a full-stack javascript / typescript developer with 15 years experience with building websites, applications and games. 

I am currently enjoying working with Vite / React / Typescript / PostCSS. 

I am the co-founder and head of technology over at [Symplify](https://www.symplify.co.uk). Symplify is a software startup that provides a digital platform for Speech and Language therapists. Symplify is a subscription service that empowers therapists with powerful tools and communication-rich therapy activities to augment their therapy sessions.

Generative art is a huge passion of mine - I use programming to create patterns and shapes that can be drawn by Stephen (my pen robot). You can read more about that over at [hyperkinetic.art](https://www.hyperkinetic.art).
